        <p>I've recently been given feedback from a trusted source: I need a better social presence, particuarly on LinkedIn. Being one who takes candid feedback seriously, I set out to figure out what that means, and how to make it valuble to readers.</p>
<h1>The Starting Point</h1>
<p>Being younger side of GenX means I grew up with computers, but not social media.  Ironically, being a technologist in San Francisco / Silicon Valley, I've consulted at most social media companies, which has been massively fun building the sheer scale needed to make the UX fast and easy. </p>
<p>But... as a user?  Meh, I don't feel compelled to post pictures of every meal or curate the image of my perfect life.  My life is messy and crazy, and I love every minute.  But if I'm going to build a "social presence", I would like it to be valuble to readers.  Otherwise I might as well be posting pictures of spegetti.</p>
<p>BTW - I recognize this need for tangible value misses the point of being "social" media.  This is my hang-up, not yours.  I'll try to keep it fun and casual and most of all, short.</p>
<h1>The Journey</h1>
<p>There are many smart and thoughtful leader publishing helpful insights into our quickly evolving world.</p>
<h1>The Mess Below</h1>
<p>Unfortunately, there are 1,000 AI bots popping  is exponentially increasing the amount of high-noise, low-value content.  , and I would i.e., publishing yet another post on how data is critical toAI is going to eat the world is uninteresting, both to write and to read.  </p>
<p>There is a LOT of content out there, most of it rehashing the same dozen talking points.</p>
<p>What seems interesting is documenting my multi-dimentional journey: both 
- through this experiment of building a (hopefully) valueble "social presense", 
- through a shifting tech landscape that will be unrecognizable / commoditized in a few more years, 
- through discoveries</p>
