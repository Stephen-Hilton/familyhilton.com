Hi, I’m **Stephen**. I like taking fuzzy problems, making them simple, and getting them across the finish line. I’ve worked in both scrappy startup mode and inside bigger organizations, and my sweet spot is turning “we should…” into “we shipped.” I’m pretty calm under pressure, direct without being harsh, and I try to keep teams focused on what actually matters.

My approach is simple: start with people, not assumptions. I spend time with customers and teammates so we’re solving real problems, not chasing the next shiney fad. From there I break work into clear milestones, write down decisions, and build lightweight guardrails so specialists can do great work without constant check-ins. I’m big on crisp artifacts—one-pagers, specs, and simple dashboards that keep everyone aligned. No theatrics, just momentum.

I care about culture as much as shipping. I mentor early-career folks, set clean interfaces between functions, and put basic rhythms in place—weekly checkpoints, written status, and a shared backlog that isn’t a junk drawer. I like switching altitudes when needed: strategy in the morning, debugging a thorny issue after lunch, and a quick retro before we wrap.

I’m also comfortable owning the unglamorous parts of work: the edge cases, the handoffs, the “who’s actually responsible for this?” moments. If something is vague, I’ll clarify it. If it’s slow, I’ll simplify it. If it’s risky, I’ll stage it.

Outside of work, I’m a curious generalist. I like learning new tools, reading widely, and getting outside whenever I can. Friends would probably say I’m steady, optimistic, and good at making complex ideas feel straightforward.

If you’re into clear thinking and consistent delivery—and you like working with kind, low-ego people—there’s a good chance we’d get along.  Let's talk!
